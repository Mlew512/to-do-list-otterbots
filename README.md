Step 1: Setup
Form teams of 2-3 junior developers. Assign roles such as "Developers-1," "Developers-2," and "Testers."
Create a GitHub repository for the project. One team member creates the repository and adds the others as collaborators.


Step 2: Planning
As a team, discuss the features of your To-Do List Manager (adding tasks, marking tasks as done, deleting tasks).
Outline the structure of the project: folder structure, file naming conventions, and functions to be implemented.


Step 3: TDD Setup
"Developers-1 and Testers" start by creating a test file (e.g., test_todo_manager.py) for the Python code, 
and "Developers-2 and testers" create a test file (e.g., todo_manager.test.js) for the JavaScript code.
Choose a simple feature (e.g., adding tasks) and write a failing test for it.


Step 4: TDD Implementation
"Developers-1" starts implementing the Python function to add tasks, making the test pass.
Simultaneously, "Developers-2" does the same for the JavaScript function.


Step 5: Code Review and Testing
Switch roles: "Developers-1" reviews the JavaScript code, and "Developers-2" reviews the Python code.
Make sure the code adheres to best practices, is well-documented, and passes the tests.
Test the code thoroughly with different inputs.

Step 6: Expanding Functionality
As a team, decide on the next feature to implement (e.g., marking tasks as done).
Repeat Steps 3 to 5 for the new feature.

Step 7: Merging and Integration
Merge the code changes into the main branch of the repository.
Ensure that the Python and JavaScript parts of the project are functional.

Step 8: Final Testing and Documentation
"Tester" tests the To-Do List Manager's features comprehensively.
Teams update the README with instructions on how to run the application and tests.
Bonus Challenges (Optional)
Implement additional features such as editing tasks and prioritizing tasks.
Enhance the user interface by adding a simple web-based interface using HTML and CSS.

Conclusion
This exercise challenges you to collaborate, code, test, and integrate using Git, GitHub, Python, and JavaScript.
Through teamwork and TDD, you gain practical experience in version control, coding fundamentals, and writing test cases, 
setting a solid foundation for your software development journey. 
By building a To-Do List Manager, you not only learn coding skills but also apply them to solve real-world problems.
